## Svelte

Svelte is a compiler that takes your declarative components and converts them into efficient JavaScript that surgically updates the DOM.

## The Tutorial

This is a tutorial where I'm following along with Traversy Media's Svelte tutorial. I've added some notes and comments to help me understand the code better.

## Branches

- `main` - the tutorial project
- `learning-branch` - my own branch where I'm adding notes and comments to help me understand the code better.
